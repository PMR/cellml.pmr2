        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.1 - Unreleased
        ----------------
        
        * Extracted all CellML related functionality found in pmr2.app into this
        package.
        * Merged functions provided in pmr2.processor.cmeta into this package.
        * Keywords and other metadata no longer depends on the presence of
        citations for the Cmeta annotations.
        * Updated code generation, now generates CellML 1.1 code using the
        cellml.api.simple package.
        * Also no longer deadlocks server process due to the usage of fork
        (workaround of the select syscall locking issue by the API).
        * Rendering of generated code uses shjs for highlighting.
        * Various OpenCell specific views added.  Merged the launch via OpenCell
        link into the session link (i.e. when no session file is specified,
        the CellML file will be launched via that link instead).
