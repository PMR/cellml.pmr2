Description: ============
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides CellML Support for PMR2, specifically the
        generation and display of CellML related data for PMR2 Exposure files.
        
        
        ------------
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This package requires Plone 3 or later, however Plone 4 is now the
        supported version thus Plone 3 support will not be not explicitly
        tested.
        
        
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Installing with buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can install cellml.pmr2 using `buildout`_.
        
        However this module depends on the CellML API Python bindings, which
        requires its own buildout process.  The best way to install this is to
        use the default PMR2 buildout, which includes all dependencies required
        to get you started using PMR2 with CellML support.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        However, if you must install this package on your own, you may do this
        in your `buildout.cfg` file.
        
        Example::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        
        [instance]
        ...
        
        eggs =
        ...
        cellml.pmr2
        
        zcml =
        ...
        cellml.pmr2

        * Extracted all CellML related functionality found in pmr2.app into this

        * Merged functions provided in pmr2.processor.cmeta into this package.
        * Keywords and other metadata no longer depends on the presence of
        citations for the Cmeta annotations.
        * Updated code generation, now generates CellML 1.1 code using the
        cellml.api.simple package.
        * Also no longer deadlocks server process due to the usage of fork
        (workaround of the select syscall locking issue by the API).
        * Rendering of generated code uses shjs for highlighting.
        * Various OpenCell specific views added.  Merged the launch via OpenCell
        link into the session link (i.e. when no session file is specified,
        the CellML file will be launched via that link instead).
